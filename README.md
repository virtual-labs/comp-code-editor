# Virtual Labs Code Assessment Tool

## Introduction

Welcome to the Virtual Labs Code Assessment Tool repository! This tool is designed to provide experiment developers with an efficient way to integrate code assessment exercises into their experiments. With a simple JSON file containing problem statements, inputs, and expected outputs, this tool offers a JavaScript-based code IDE where learners can code their solutions for the respective problems and simultaneously check for the outputs. The tool also enables the developers to add multiple problem exercises and for learners to seamlessly navigate between problems, making their learning experience fruitful and joyous.

## Target Audience

- `Educators`: Teachers, instructors, and educators looking to incorporate coding exercises into their curriculum or training programs.
- `Experiment Developers`: Researchers and experiment designers who require code assessment tasks as part of their experiments.
- `Learners`: Students, learners who would be using the code assessment tool to try coding exercises as part of their learning curriculum
